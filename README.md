# Linear Regression Model : 
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used in machine learning for predicting continuous values based on a relationship between one or more independent variables (predictor variables) and a dependent variable (what you want to predict). It's essentially finding a linear equation that best fits the data points.
The Iris dataset is not ideally suited for linear regression because it has a categorical target variable (flower species) and linear regression works best for continuous target variables. However, we can still explore building a simple linear regression model on a single numeric feature of the Iris dataset for demonstration purposes.
