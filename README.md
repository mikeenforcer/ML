** Linear Regression Model : The Iris dataset is not ideally suited for linear regression because it has a categorical target variable (flower species) and linear regression works best for continuous target variables. However, we can still explore building a simple linear regression model on a single numeric feature of the Iris dataset for demonstration purposes.
